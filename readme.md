## Welcome to Bike Builder

Bike Builder is a sample problem that Wisetail uses during the interview process. 
This problem has two goals: 
1. Prove you can code in Laravel 
2. Provide a shared foundation for us to talk with you about code. 

## Get Started

Step 1: Download this repo onto your machine. 
Step 2: Inside the project folder, run laravel init.
Step 3: Run database migrations. 
Step 4: Run database seeder.
Step 5: Run php artisan serve.

At this point, you should have a running api. You can test this by hitting X endpoint. 

Step 6: Add a new Seat resource.
