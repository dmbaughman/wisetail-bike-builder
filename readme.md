## Welcome to Bike Builder

Bike Builder is a sample problem that Wisetail uses during the interview process. 
This problem has two goals: 

1. Prove you can code in Laravel 

2. Provide a shared foundation for us to talk with you about code. 

## Get Started

Step 1: Download or Clone this repo onto your machine. 

Step 2: Inside the project folder, run composer update.

Step 3: Run php artisan serve.

Step 4: Run database migrations. 

Step 5: Run database seeder.

At this point, you should have a running api. You can test this by hitting X endpoint. 

Step 6: Add a new Seat resource.
